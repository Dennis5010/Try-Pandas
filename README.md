# Try Pandas
In this series, we're going to learn the fundamentals of the popular Python data science tool called Pandas.

Pandas is a fast data science tool written on Python. It's an amazing way to work with spreadsheets and peform all kinds of analysis. 

To learn Pandas, we'll be using an interactive notebook environment (also known as Jupyter Notebooks) so we can, visualize our results, experiment rapidly, and collaborate with others.

To get started, setup a deepnote environment (a collaborative space to run notebooks):

The above link will copy all the code we have provided on [this github repository](https://github.com/codingforentrepreneurs/Try-Pandas). Once you have the code, you can start working in the notebooks.
